# Scripted Trade Framework

This folder introduces the Scripted Trade framework by discussing various
representations of
- European Equity Options
- Equity Barrier Options
- Equity Accumulators

The trades are represented
- in "classic" ORE XML and priced with classic QuantLib-style methods where possible,
(i.e. in the first two cases)
- and as Scripted Trades (in all cases).

The **ORE Scripted Trade** document and the **ORE Product Catalogue** provide the full picture.

And in the **Products Examle** section provides a representative portfolio of products
across asset classes including several Scripted Trades.
