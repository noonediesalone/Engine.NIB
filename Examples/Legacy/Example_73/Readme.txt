Creates an AMC exposure simulation and XVA for a forward and a plain vanilla bond.
The results can be compared to a classical exposure simulation by switchting the parameter "amc"
in the main configuration file "ore.xml", section analytic type Simulation to "N".

Notice the spread imply from bond prices (see userguide).

Run with "python run.py"
