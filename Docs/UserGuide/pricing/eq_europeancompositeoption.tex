\subsubsection{European Equity Composite Option}
\label{pricing:eq_compo_option}

Vanilla European Composite Options are priced analytically using the Black-Scholes 
model and log-normal volatilities. 

\medskip
The Black-Scholes model assumes that the spot price of the underlying equity $S$ and the 
FX spot price $X$ follow a Geometric Brownian Motion:
\begin{align*}
dS/S &= \mu_S(t)dt+\sigma_S(t)\,dW \\
dX/X &= \mu_X(t)dt+\sigma_X(t)\,dW_X
\end{align*}
with correlated standard Brownian motions $W$ and $W_X$, with correlation coefficient $\rho$.

The final payoff depends on the product of both processes $X(T)S(T)$.

The present value is given by Black Scholes Merton formula using the transformed volatility of the underlying into payoff currency
$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma_S^2 + \sigma_X^2 - 2 \rho \sigma^S \sigma^X}$$
and the risk free rate of the payoff currency.
