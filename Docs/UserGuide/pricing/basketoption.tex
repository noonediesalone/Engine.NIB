\subsubsection{Basket Option}
\label{pricing::basektoption}

A basket option is a European option written on a basket of
$n$ underlying equities. The basket price is a weighted average of equity
prices, taking FX conversions into the payoff currency into account. 

Basket options are priced using correlated Black-Scholes processes for
the underlyings $S_i$ calibrated to their quoted market ATM
volatility. The valuation is done using a Monte Carlo simulation.
