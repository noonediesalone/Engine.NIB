\subsubsection{Forward Rate Agreement}
\label{pricing:ir_fra}

The NPV of a Forward Rate Agreement, from the point of view of the party 
receiving the fixed predetermined rate, assuming payments are made at time $t_2$:
$$
\NPV= N\cdot (c - f(t_1,t_2))\cdot \delta (t_1, t_2) \cdot P(t_2)         
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $c$: the predetermined fixed forward interest rate, set in the terms 
of the FRA (at $t_0$) to be received at time $t_2$
\item $f(t_1,t_2)$: the forward projected IBOR rate for the period from $t_1$ 
to $t_2$, to be paid at $t_2$
\item $\delta(t_1, t_2)$: the daycount fraction in years for the period from $t_1$ 
to $t_2$
\item $P(t_2)$: the discount factor for time $t_2$
\end{itemize}

Note that market practice dictates the payments are made in $t_1$ by 
computing the cash flow in $t_2$ and discounting it to $t_1$. For pricing 
purposes, this has practically no impact - see 
(Lichters, Stamm, \& Gallagher, 2015) Ch. 11.1.
