\subsubsection{Zero Coupon Swap}
\label{pricing:ir_zero}

On compounding swaps, the floating rate is applied to the notional amount plus 
accrued interest caused by the previous floating rate(s). On payment date, the 
accrued amounts for multiple accrual periods are summed. Both 
straight\footnote{The spread compounds (i.e. is applied to the notional amount 
plus accrued interest).} and flat compounding is supported for zero-coupon swaps. 

\medskip
A zero-coupon swap compounds at the tenor of the swap and pays only at maturity. 
There are zero-coupon fixed and zero-coupon floating legs:
\begin{align*}
\NPV &= P(T)\,\sum_{i=1}^n A_i \\
A_i &= \left\{\begin{array}{lcl}
\displaystyle N\,c\,\delta_i + \left(\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} A_j\right)\,c\,\delta_i 
&;& \mbox{for a fixed ZC leg} \\
\displaystyle N\,(f_i+s_i)\,\delta_i + \left(\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} A_j\right)\,(f_i+s_i)\,\delta_i 
&;& \mbox{for a floating ZC leg} \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: notional
\item $c$: the fixed rate
\item $f_i$: the forward projected IBOR rate for period $i$ from $t_{i-1}$ to $t_i$ 
\item $s_i$: floating spread for period $i$ 
\item $\delta_i$: the daycount fraction in years for the period from $t_{i-1}$ to $t_i$ 
\item $P(T)$: the discount factor for maturity $T$
\item $A_i$: the accrued interest up to period $u$ 
\end{itemize}
