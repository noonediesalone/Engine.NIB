\subsubsection{CMB Swap}
\label{pricing:ir_cmb}

Constant Maturity Bond (CMB)-linked coupons (linked to an index of form CMB-FAMILY-TENOR)
are priced using simple projection of a bond yields, i.e. computing the yield of a forward starting bond with
start date on the coupon's fixing date and same tenor as specified in the index' name.
The forward yield calculation is determined by the reference data maintained for the Bond family, its
associated yield curve (stripped from benchmark bonds prices or yields of that family) and the
conventions for converting bond prices into yields.

Note that in contrast CMS index projections, we currently do not apply convexity adjustments to projected CMB indices.
