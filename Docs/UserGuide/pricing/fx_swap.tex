\subsubsection{FX Swap}
\label{pricing:fx_swap}

The FX Swap is priced as a portfolio of two FX Forwards (see
\ref{pricing:fx_forward}), where the ``near'' leg is 
disregarded if the cash flow time has passed (and the NPV vanishes when the the 
``far'' leg's cash flow time has passed as well).
%The NPV in currency A at time 0 (which is before start time t) for an FX Swap 
%where the holder receives currency A and pays currency B at start t (and the reverse at maturity T):  
%?NPV?_FXSwap=N_A??df?_AT-?X_0^(A/B)?N?_BT??df?_BT
%?-N?_A+?X_0^(A/B)?N?_B0
%
%Where:
%?N_BT=N?_A?X_T^(B/A)
%N_B0=?N_A?X?_0^(B/A)
%N_A: the set amount in currency A which is paid at start, and received at maturity 
%N_B0: the set amount in currency B to be received at start 0
%X_0^(A/B): the FX spot rate between currencies A and B at start 0
%X_T^(A/B): the FX forward rate between currencies A and B for maturity T at start 0
%N_BT : the amount in currency B to be paid at maturity T
%?df?_AT: the discount factor from maturity T to start 0 for currency A
%?df?_BT: the discount factor from maturity T to start 0 for currency B
%
%The first line of the FX Swap NPV reflects the FX forward component, and the second line the FX Spot component. Note that as the NPV is expressed in currency A, the exchanged amount in currency A is the same at start and maturity, whereas the amount received in currency B at maturity depends on the FX forward rate, and the amount paid at start in currency B depends on the FX spot rate.
