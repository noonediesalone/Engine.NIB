\subsubsection{CPI Cap/Floor}
\label{pricing:inf_zciicapfloor}

The CPI Cap/Floor payoff is
$$
\Pi_{ZCIICF}(T) = N\,\left(\omega\left(\frac{I(T)}{I(T_0)} - K\right)\right)^+
$$
where $\omega=1$ for the Cap and $\omega=-1$ for the Floor.

\medskip
To price the Cap/Floor, one considers the {\em Forward Inflation Index} 
$$
F(t,T) = \frac{I(t)}{I(T_0)}\,\frac{P_r(t,T)}{P(t,T)}, \qquad  F(T,T) = \frac{I(T)}{I(T_0)}
$$
where $P_r(t,T)$ is the ``Real Rate Bond Price'' curve stripped from CPI Swap quotes. 
$F(t,T)$ is a ratio of tradable assets and a Martingale in the T-Forward measure. 

\medskip
We then assume that $F(t,T)$ follows Geometric Brownian Motion without drift in the 
$T$-Forward measure, so that we obtain a Black pricing formula for the CPI Cap/Floor
$$
\NPV(0) = N\:P(T)\:\mbox{Black}(K, F(0,T),\sigma\sqrt{T},\omega)
$$

\medskip
CPI Caps/Floors are primarily quoted in terms of cap and floor prices by maturity and 
strike rate $r$ (with $K=(1+r)^{T-T_0}$). We convert them to equivalent 
Black volatilities $\sigma_{r,T}$.
