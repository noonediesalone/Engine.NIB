\subsubsection{European Commodity Option}
\label{pricing:com_option}

European Commodity Options are priced using the Black-Scholes model with log-normal 
volatilities. Volatility structures with smile are taken into account where available. 
The commodity forwarding curve is used for respective commodity.

The Black-Scholes model assumes that the spot commodity price C follows Geometric 
Brownian Motion:
$$
dC/C=\mu(t)dt + \sigma(t)\,dW
$$
The model?s drift is calibrated such that the expected future spot commodity price 
agrees with today?s fair forward commodity price for time T. This means that the 
commodity forward rate $F(t,T)$ follows drift-free GBM under the T-forward measure:
$$
dF(t,T)) = \sigma(t)\,F(t,T)\,dW
$$
This leads a Black76 analytical solution for the present value of a European FX option:
$$
\NPV = N\cdot \mbox{Black}(K, F(0,T), \sigma\sqrt{T},\omega)\cdot?P(T)
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: notional
\item $K$: strike price
\item $F(0,T)$: the forward commodity price for maturity $T$ at time 0 (start)
\item $\sigma$: the volatility of the commodity forward price
\item $\omega$: 1 for a call option, -1 for a put option
\item $P(T)$: the discount factor for maturity time $T$
\end{itemize}
