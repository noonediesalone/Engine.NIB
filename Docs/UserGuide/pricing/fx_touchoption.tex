\subsubsection{FX Touch Option}
\label{pricing:fx_touchoption}

FX Touch Options are priced analytically using the Garman-Kohlhagen 
model and log-normal volatilities.  Deterministic IR rates are assumed. Volatility 
structures with smile are used where available.

The Garman-Kohlhagen model assumes that the spot FX rate $X$ follows Geometric 
Brownian Motion:
$$
dX/X=\mu(t)\,dt+\sigma(t)\,dW
$$
