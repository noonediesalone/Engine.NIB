\subsubsection{Equity Position}

The price of an equity position is directly derived from the market quote(s) of the underlying share(s). For a basket
the weighting is taken into account and if equities in several currencies are present in the basket, the equity prices
are converted to a common npv currency using the current FX Spot rates. The npv currency is by convention the currency
of the first equity in the basket.
