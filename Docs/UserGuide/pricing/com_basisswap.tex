\subsubsection{Commodity Basis Swap}
\label{pricing:com_basisswap}

The net present value of each calculation period in a Commodity Basis Swap 
can be computed following \cite{Clark_2014}, and slightly extending
Section \ref{pricing:com_swap}
:
$$
\NPV = \mbox{Quantity}\cdot \omega\cdot \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^n
  \left(F^{(1)}(0,T_i) - F^{(2)}(0,T_i) - K\right) \cdot P(T_i^{Set})
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantity: number of units of the underlying commodity
\item $K$: strike price
\item the sum runs over all fixing dates $t_i$ across all calculation
  periods, $i=1, ..., N$
\item $F^{(1,2)}(0,T_i)$: the forward price of commodity 1 resp. 2 for
  maturity $T_i$ seen at time 0 (valuation date), $T_i$ is the prompt
  futures expiry date  associated with the fixing date $t_i$ if the
  Swap references Futures  prices, or it is the fixing date $t_i$ if
  the  Swap references Commodity spot prices.
\item $P(T_i^{Set})$: the discount factor for settlement date
  following fixing date $T_i$, possibly a number of business days
  (typically five) past the next calculation period end, or past the
  Swap's final calculation period  end if all payouts are rolled up
  into a single payment 
\item $\omega$: +1 for a long Commodity Swap, -1 otherwise 
\end{itemize}
