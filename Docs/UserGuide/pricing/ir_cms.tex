\subsubsection{CMS Swap, CMS Cap/Floor}
\label{pricing:ir_cms}

CMS-linked cash flows (in CMS Swaps and CMS Cap/Floors) are priced using 
replication approaches following Andersen \& Piterbarg's Linear Terminal Swap 
Rate model (LTSR), see section \ref{models:LTSR}. The LTSR model supports normal, 
log-normal, and shifted log-normal volatilities. LTSR model parameters are 
Mean Reversion, and upper and lower rate bounds.
