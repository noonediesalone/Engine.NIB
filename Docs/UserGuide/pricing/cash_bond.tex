\subsubsection{Bond}

A vanilla bond is priced by discounting its future coupon and notional payments. The discounting is done on a reference
curve (typically a Libor curve in the bond currency) plus possibly a security specific spread. In addition default risk
can be taken into account by weighting the payments with their respective survival probability and adding a recovery
value reflecting the value of a recovery payment in case of the default of the issuer.

If there are liquid price quotes available for a bond, the security spread can be implied to match this price given a
reference curve and (possibly) a default curve.
