\subsubsection{European Swaption}
\label{pricing:ir_euroswaption}

Standard European Swaptions are priced using the Black model for log-normal and shifted
log-normal volatilities, and the Bachelier model for normal volatilities. The 
full volatility smile (cube) is taken into account where available.

Trades are considered a ``standard European swaption'' if the following criteria are met:

\begin{itemize}
\item the exercise type is set to European (if set to Bermudan, and only one exercise date is present, this does {\em not} count as European!)
\item the underlying has exactly two legs, one payer, one receiever and one of type ``Fixed'', one of type ``Floating''
\item the underlying notional is constant
\item the underlying fixed rate is constant
\item the underlying float margin is constant
\item the underlying float gearing is constant
\item the underlying float index is Ibor (OIS, BMA do not count as Standard) and fixes in advance (i.e. not in arrears)
\item the underlying has no embedded caps / floors
\end{itemize}

If a trade is not classified as ``standard European'', it is priced using the Bermudan pricer, see
\ref{pricing:ir_bermswaption}.

\subsubsection*{Black model - log-normal volatilities}

A swaption can be regarded as a single option on the forward swap rate with 
repeated payoffs. Assuming the forward swap rate $F(t;t_s, t_e)$ for swaption 
expiry (start) $t_s$, to underlying swap maturity (end) $t_e$ follows 
Geometric Brownian Motion under the swap forward measure,
$$
dF / F = \sigma_{t_s,t_e}(t)\,dW(t)
$$
Then the Black model gives the following analytical solution for the present 
value of a European swaption (assuming log-normal volatilities):
$$
\NPV = N \,\sum_{i=1}^n \mbox{Black}(K, F(t_0; t_s,t_e), \sigma_{t_s,t_e} \sqrt{t_s},\omega)\cdot A_{t_s t_e}
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: notional
\item $K$: strike rate
\item $F(t_0,t_s,t_e)$: the forward projected swap rate from swaption expiry 
to underlying swap maturity at time 0 
\item $\sigma_{t_s,t_e}$: the volatility of the forward swap rate corresponding 
to the start $t_s$ and end $t_e$ of the period
\item $\omega$: 1 for a payer swaption, -1 for a receiver swaption
\item $A_{t_s t_e}$: an annuity at time 0, for physical settlement and cash settlement using the collateralized cash
  price method, this is
$$
A_{t_s, t_e} = \sum_{i=s+1}^e \delta_i\,P(t_i) 
$$
and for cash settlement using the par yield curve method, this is
$$
A_{t_s, t_e} = P(t_s) \sum_{i=s+1}^e \delta_i\,(1+y)^{-(t_i-t_s)}
$$
with $y$ denoting the fair swap rate observed at the option expiry date.
\item $\delta_i$: the daycount fraction in years for the period from $t_{i-1}$ to $t_i$
\item $P(t_i)$: the discount factor for time $t_i$
\end{itemize}

See Black Model, Section \ref{models:black}, for more details.

\subsubsection*{Black model - shifted log-normal volatilities}

For shifted log-normal volatilities, the present value of a European swaption 
uses the same analytical solution as above, but with forward swap rate $F$ and 
strike K amended to include a displacement parameter.  
See Section \ref{models:black}.

\subsubsection*{Bachelier model - normal volatilities}

Under the Bachelier model it is assumed the forward swap rate $F(t; t_s, t_e)$  
for swaption expiry (start) $t_s$ to underlying swap maturity (end) $t_e$ follows 
Arithmetic Brownian Motion under the swap forward measure:
$$
dF=\sigma_{t_s,t_e}(t)\,dW(t)
$$
Then, the Bachelier model gives the following analytical solution for the 
present value of a European swaption, assuming normal volatilities:
$$
\NPV=N\,\sum_{i=1}^n\mbox{Bachelier}(K,F(t_0; t_s, t_e),\sigma_{t_s,t_e}\sqrt{t_s},\omega)\cdot A_{t_s t_e}
$$
See Bachelier Model, Section \ref{models:bachelier}, for more details.

\subsubsection*{Numerical engines}

Alternatively, a European Swaption can be priced using one of the numerical pricers that are designed for Bermudan /
American Swaptions. See section \ref{pricing:ir_bermswaption} for possible configurations of the numerical integration
and finite-difference pricers, they work for product type ``EuropeanSwaption'' as well.
