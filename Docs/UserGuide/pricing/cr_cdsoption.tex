\subsubsection{CDS Option}
\label{pricing:cr_cdsoption}

The CDS Option payoff can be written
$$
\NPV_{CDSO}(t_e)=\left[ \NPV_{\CDS}(t_e) \right]^+
$$
where $\NPV_{\CDS}(t_e)$ is the present value of the underlying
CDS on exercise date $t_e$ with specified reference credit,  
CDS maturity and contractual CDS spread (strike).

\medskip
CDS Options are priced, in analogy to European Swaptions, using the
Black model. Following the European Swaption pricing approach, we
write the time $t$ price of a forward CDS (starting at time $t_s>t$
and maturing on time $t_m>t_s$)
$$
\NPV_{CDS}(t) = \omega\,(S(t) - K)\,A(t;t_s,t_m)
$$ 
in terms of running spread $K$, fair forward CDS spread $S(t)$ and
risky annuity $A(t;t_s,t_m)$
\begin{align*}
S(t) &= \frac{1}{A(t;t_s,t_m)} \times \mbox{Default Leg NPV} \\
A(t;t_s,t_m) &=
\frac{1}{K}\times(\mbox{Coupon Leg NPV + Accrual NPV})
\end{align*}
(see section \ref{pricing:cr_cds}). The option price in the risky
annuity measure is then
$$
\NPV_{CDSO}(t) = A(t;t_s,t_m) \:\E^A_t\left[(\omega(S(T)-K))^+ \right]
$$
Assuming log-normal dynamics for thr forward CDS spread $S(t)$ we
arrive at a Black formula for today's CDS Option price
$$
\NPV_{CDSO} = N \,\sum_{i=1}^n \mbox{Black}(K, S(t_0), \sigma_{t_s,t_m} \sqrt{t_s},\omega)\cdot A(t_s, t_m)
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: notional
\item $K$: CDS (running) premium 
\item $S(t_0)$: today's forward CDS spread for CDS start $t_s$
  and maturity $t_m$ 
\item $\sigma_{t_s,t_m}$: volatility of the forward CDS spread corresponding 
to the start $t_s$ and maturity $t_m$ of the period
\item $\omega$: 1 for a protection buyer (premium payer), -1 for a
  protection seller
\item $A(t_s,t_m)$: risky annuity for the period from $t_s$ to $t_m$
  as of today, 
$$
A(t_s, t_m)= \sum_{i=s+1}^m \delta_i\,P(t_i) \,S(t_i)
$$
\item $\delta_i$: the daycount fraction in years for the period from $t_{i-1}$ to $t_i$
\item $P(t_i)$: the discount factor for time $t_i$
\item $S(t_i)$: the survival probability for time $t_i$
\end{itemize}

See Black Model, Section \ref{models:black}, for more details.
 
\medskip

If the option underlying contains an upfront spread, this is 
converted into a corresponding running spread adjustment.

\medskip
If the CDS Option contract contains {\em front end protection} and the
underlying CDS is a protection buyer, then we add the value contribution
$$
N\cdot \LGD\cdot (1-S(t_s))\cdot P(t_s)
$$

\medskip
Apart from discount curve, default/survival probability curves and
LGDs, CDS Option pricing requires Black volatilities which may be
available only for index CDS Options for a limited range of indices
and short expiries.
