\subsubsection{Equity Touch Option}
\label{pricing:eq_touchoption}

Equity Touch Equity Options are priced analytically using the Black-Scholes 
model and log-normal volatilities. The equity forwarding curve is used for 
respective underlying equity.

\medskip
The Black-Scholes model assumes that the spot price of the underlying equity $S$ 
follows Geometric Brownian Motion:
$$
dS/S=\mu(t)dt+\sigma(t)\,dW
$$
