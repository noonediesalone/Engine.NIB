\subsubsection{American FX Option}
\label{pricing:fx_americanoption}

Vanilla American FX Options can be either priced
\begin{itemize}
\item approximately using the Barone-Adesi and Whaley model with
time-independent deal strike volatility. See Section \ref{models:barone-adesi}, or
\item numerically using Finite Difference Methods with the Black-Scholes
framework and time-dependent deal strike volatility. Parameters are for setting
the grid size and damping steps to limit the expansion of the grid.
For discretization in time, number of grid points is scaled by bucketed expiry of the deal.
For discretization in FX spot, there is no scaling.
Damping steps, where Implicit Euler Scheme is used, are added to the beginning
of discretization in time when the model rolls back from option maturity.

Note that the current implementation assumes payoff at exercise.
\end{itemize}
