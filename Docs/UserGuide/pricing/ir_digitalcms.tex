\subsubsection{Digital CMS Option}
\label{pricing:ir_digitalcms}

Similar to CMS swaps, Digital CMS Options are priced using the Linear Terminal
Swap Rate model (LTSR) (see section \ref{models:LTSR}), while the digital coupon
payoffs in the underlying CMS swap are replicated using call/put option spreads.
