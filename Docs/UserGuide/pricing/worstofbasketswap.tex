\subsubsection{Worst Of Basket Swap}
\label{pricing::worstofbasketswap}

A Worst Of Basket Swap is priced in a Hull White model calibrated to ATM coterminal swaptions.
The valuation is done using a Monte Carlo simulation.

The final equity amount is determined by the strike price of the worst-performing asset at the final
valuation date, taking FX conversions into the payoff currency into account.

See \ref{pricing::scriptedtrade_mc} for more details, the relevant product classification is MultiUnderlyingIrOption if
the basket consists only of InterestRate underlyings. Otherwise (if the basket consists of Equity, FX or Commodity) the
product classification is IrHybrid.
