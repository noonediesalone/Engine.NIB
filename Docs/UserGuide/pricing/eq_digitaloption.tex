\subsubsection{Equity Digital Option}
\label{pricing:eq_digitaloption}

Equity Digital Options are cash-or-nothing instruments on an underlying Equity spot rate.
They can be either priced 
\begin{itemize}
\item analytically using formulas developed by \cite{Rubinstein_1991} 
based on the Black-Scholes framework, see \cite{Haug_1997} Ch 4.19.2, or
\item as call respectively put spreads
\end{itemize}

In the current implementation, Equity Digital Options are priced analytically as described in section
\ref{pricing:eq_option_digital_analytical}.

\subsubsection*{Analytical Equity Digital Option}\label{pricing:eq_option_digital_analytical}

The NPV of a Equity Digital Option can be expressed as:
$$
\NPV = \mbox{Quantity}\cdot N \cdot P(T)\cdot \Phi(\omega\,d), \qquad d = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}\left(\ln\frac{S(0,T)}{K} - \frac{\sigma^2 T}{2}\right)
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantity: number of shares of the underlying equity
\item $N$: the amount per number of shares to be paid at expiration if the option is in-the-money
\item $P(T)$: the discount factor for option expiry time $T$
\item $\Phi(\cdot)$: the cumulative standard normal distribution
\item $\omega$: 1 for a call option, -1 for a put option
\item $S(0,T)$: the forward equity price for maturity T at time 0 (valuation date)
\item $K$: strike price
\item $\sigma$: the volatility of the equity forward price
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equity Digital Option as Call/Put Spread}\label{pricing:eq_option_digital_callspread}

Alternatively, when a more accurate reflection of volatility smiles is a priority, 
Equity Digital Options can be priced using call/put spreads (i.e. by approximating 
the Equity Digital Option payment with the difference between two European Vanilla 
Equity Options). Given a Digital Call/Put option with strike price K, the two V
anilla Call/Put Options will have strikes $K_- \leq K$ and $K_+\geq K$, where 
$K_\pm=K \pm\epsilon$ and $\epsilon$ is small.

The present value of one Equity Digital Call and Put Options with strike K and payout 
amount $M$ in payoff currency A, can be expressed in terms of bought and sold Vanilla 
Equity Calls/Puts with underlying quantity $Q$ and strike $K_\pm$ 
in currency A. All PVs are expressed in currency A:
\begin{align*}
\NPV_{DigitalCall}(M,K) &\approx\NPV_{Call}(Q,K_-) - \NPV_{Call}(Q,K_+) \\
\NPV_{DigitalPut}(M,K) &\approx\NPV_{Put}(Q,K_+) - \NPV_{Put}(Q,K_-) 
\end{align*}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $M$: the amount in payoff currency A to be paid at expiration if the Digital 
Call/Put is in-the-money
\item $Q = M/(K_+ - K_-)$
\end{itemize}

The European Vanilla Equity Options are priced with the Black-Scholes / Black76
analytic formula (Section \ref{pricing:eq_option}).
