\subsubsection{Commodity Futures Option}
\label{pricing:com_futuresoption}

Though Commodity Futures Options can be technically American style
 (as e.g. in the case of base metal futures options at LME),
we treat them as European options following \cite{Clark_2014}.

The option payoff on option exercise date $t_e$ with underlying futures
contract expiry $T>t_e$  is
$$
\NPV(t_e) = N\cdot \left(\omega(F(t_e, T) - K)\right)^+.
$$
We assume that the futures price follows Geometric Brownian Motion:
$$
dF(t,T)) = \sigma(t)\,F(t,T)\,dW.
$$
This leads to a Black76 analytical solution for the present value of
the Futures Option:
$$
\NPV = N\cdot \mbox{Black}(K, F(0,T), \sigma\sqrt{t_e},\omega)\cdot P(T)
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: notional (units of the underyling futures contract)
\item $K$: strike price
\item $F(0,T)$: the futures price for contract expiry $T$ at time 0 (start)
\item $\sigma$: the volatility of the commodity futures price
\item $\omega$: 1 for a call option, -1 for a put option
\item $P(T)$: the discount factor for the underlying futures expiry $T$
\end{itemize}

See Black Model, Section \ref{sec:models}, for more details.
