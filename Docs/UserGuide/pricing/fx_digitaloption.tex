\subsubsection{Digital FX Option}
\label{pricing:fx_digitaloption}

Digital FX Options are cash or nothing instruments on an underlying FX rate.
They can be either priced 
\begin{itemize}
\item analytically using formulas developed by \cite{Rubinstein_1991} 
based on the Black-Scholes framework, see \cite{Haug_1997} Ch 4.19.2, or
\item as call respectively put spreads
\end{itemize}

In the current implementation, digital FX Options are priced analytically as described in section
\ref{pricing:fx_option_digital_analytical}.

\subsubsection*{Analytical Digital FX Option}\label{pricing:fx_option_digital_analytical}

The NPV of a Digital FX option can be expressed as:
$$
\NPV = N \cdot P(T)\cdot \Phi(\omega\,d), \qquad d = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}\left(\ln\frac{F_T}{K} - \frac{\sigma^2 T}{2}\right)
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: the amount to be paid at expiration if the option is in-the-money
\item $P(T)$: the discount factor for option expiry time $T$
\item $\Phi(\cdot)$: the cumulative standard normal distribution
\item $\omega$: 1 for a call option, -1 for a put option
\item $F_T$: the forward projected FX rate for time T at time 0  
\item $K$: the strike FX rate
\item $\sigma$: the volatility FX forward rate
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Digital FX Option as Call/Put Spread}\label{pricing:fx_option_digital_callspread}

Alternatively, when a more accurate reflection of volatility smiles is a priority, 
Digital FX options can be priced using call/put spreads (i.e. by approximating 
the digital FX option payment with the difference between two European vanilla 
FX options). Given a digital call/put option with strike rate K, the two v
anilla call/put options will have strikes $K_- \leq K$ and $K_+\geq K$, where 
$K_\pm=K \pm\epsilon$ and $\epsilon$ is small.

The present value of digital FX call and put options with strike K and payout 
amount $M$ in currency A, can be expressed in terms of bought and sold vanilla 
FX calls/puts to exchange amount $N$ of currency B for amount $K_\pm \cdot N$ 
in currency A. All PV?s are expressed in currency A:
\begin{align*}
\NPV_{DigitalCall}(M,K) &\approx\NPV_{Call}(N,K_-) - \NPV_{Call}(N,K_+) \\
\NPV_{DigitalPut}(M,K) &\approx\NPV_{Put}(N,K_+) - \NPV_{Put}(N,K_-) 
\end{align*}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $M$: the amount in currency A to be paid at expiration if the digital 
call/put is in-the-money
\item $N = M/(K_+ - K_-)$
\end{itemize}

The European vanilla FX options are priced with the Garman-Kohlhagen / Black76
analytic formula (Section \ref{pricing:fx_option}).
