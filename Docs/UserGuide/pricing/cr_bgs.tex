\subsubsection{Balance Guaranteed Swap}
\label{pricing:cr_bgs}

BGS are priced using an auxiliary Flexi Swap as a proxy. The amortization schedule 
of the Flexi Swap is set up as the notional schedule of the BGS assuming a zero 
CPR (Conditional Prepayment Rate). The lower notional bound of the Flexi Swap is 
constructed assuming a MaxCPR (Maximum Conditional Prepayment Rate) which is 
dependent on the Reference Security. The MaxCPR is estimated on the basis of 
the current CPR, historical CPRs and / or expert judgement as to provide a 
(hypothetical) sufficiently realistic hedge for the BGS. The option holder in 
the Flexi Swap is the payer of the structured leg (i.e. the leg replicating the 
payments of the reference security) in the BGS.
