\subsubsection{Commodity Forward}
\label{pricing:com_forward}

The commodity forwarding curve is used for respective underlying commodity. 
The net present value of a commodity forward can be priced discounting the 
cashflows at maturity as per:
$$
\NPV = \mbox{Quantity}\cdot \omega\cdot (F(0,T) - K) \cdot P(T)
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantity: number of units of the underlying commodity
\item $K$: strike price
\item $F(0,T)$: the forward commodity price for maturity $T$ at time 0 (valuation date)
\item $P(T)$: the discount factor for maturity time $T$
\item $\omega$: 1 for a forward to buy commodity, -1 for a forward to sell a commodity 
\end{itemize}
