\subsubsection{Vanilla European Option Contingent on a Barrier}
\label{pricing::europeanoptionbarrier}

A European option with a barrier in another underlying is priced using correlated Black-Scholes processes for the two underlyings
(option underlying and barrier underlying), unless the option underlying is an IR asset class, in which case we use Gaussian-Cam
for the IR underlying. Each process is calibrated to its quoted market ATM volatility. The correlation is an externally given parameter.
The valuation is done using a Monte Carlo simulation.

See \ref{pricing::scriptedtrade_mc} for more details, the relevant product classification is MultiAssetOption if both underlyings
are Equity, FX or COMM. If the option underlying is IR, then the product classification is IrHybrid.
