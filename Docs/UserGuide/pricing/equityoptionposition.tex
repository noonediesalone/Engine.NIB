\subsubsection{Equity Option Position}

The price of an equity option position is derived from the prices of the underlying options, see \ref{pricing:eq_option}
for details on how this is done. For a basket the weighting is taken into account and if equities in several currencies
are present in the basket, the equity prices are converted to a common npv currency using the current FX Spot rates. The
npv currency is by convention the currency of the first equity option in the basket.
