\subsubsection{BMA Swap}
\label{pricing:ir_bma}

A BMA Swap leg pays the un-compounded arithmetic average of weekly BMA Index fixings 
monthly. The present value of a BMA Swap leg can be expressed as follows:
$$
\NPV= N \,\sum_{i=1}^n (f_i + s_i)\, \delta_i \,P(t_i)
$$
Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: notional amount, typically constant, hence we have taken the notional 
outside the sum above 
\item $f_i$: the forward projected BMA rate for period $i$ from $t_{i-1}$ to $t_i$, 
composed of the arithmetic average of projected weekly BMA fixings (where the 
current week is already fixed for the current period)
\item $s_i$: spread for period $i$
\item $\delta_i$: the daycount fraction in years for the period from $t_{i-1}$ to $t_i$
\item $P(t_i)$: the discount factor for maturity $t_i$
\end{itemize}
