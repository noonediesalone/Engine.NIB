\subsubsection{European Equity Option}
\label{pricing:eq_option}

Vanilla European Equity Options are priced analytically using the Black-Scholes 
model and log-normal volatilities. The equity forwarding curve is used for 
respective underlying equity.

\medskip
The Black-Scholes model assumes that the spot price of the underlying equity $S$ 
follows Geometric Brownian Motion:
$$
dS/S=\mu(t)dt+\sigma(t)\,dW
$$
The model is calibrated  such that the expected future equity spot price agrees 
with today?s fair equity forward price for time T. This means that the equity 
forward price $S(t,T)$ follows drift-free GBM under the T-forward measure:
$$
dS(t,T)/S(t,T)=\sigma(t)\,dW
$$
This leads a Black76 analytical solution for the present value of a European 
equity option:
$$
\NPV=\mbox{Quantity}\cdot \mbox{Black}(K,S(0,T),\sigma \sqrt{T},\omega)\cdot P(T)
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantity: number of shares of the underlying equity
\item $K$: strike price
\item $S(0,T)$: the forward equity price for maturity T at time 0 (valuation date)
\item $\sigma$: the volatility of the equity forward price
\item $\omega$: 1 for a call option, -1 for a put option
\item $P(T)$: the discount factor for maturity time $T$
\end{itemize}
