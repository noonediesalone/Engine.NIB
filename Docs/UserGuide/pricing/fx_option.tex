\subsubsection{European FX Option}
\label{pricing:fx_option}

Vanilla European FX Options are priced analytically using the Garman-Kohlhagen 
model and log-normal volatilities.  Deterministic IR rates are assumed. Volatility 
structures with smile are used where available.

The Garman-Kohlhagen model assumes that the spot FX rate $X$ follows Geometric 
Brownian Motion:
$$
dX/X=\mu(t)\,dt+\sigma(t)\,dW
$$

The model?s drift is calibrated such that the expected future spot rate agrees 
with today?s fair FX forward rate for exchange at time $T$. This means that the 
FX forward rate $F(t,T)$ follows drift free GBM under the $T$-forward measure:
$$
dF(t,T)/F(t,T)=\sigma(t)\,F(t,T)\,dW
$$

This leads to a Black76 analytical solution for the present value of a European 
FX option:
$$
\NPV = N\cdot \mbox{Black}(K,F(0,T),\sigma\sqrt{T},\omega)\cdot P(T)
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: notional
\item $K$: strike FX rate
\item $F(0,T)$: the forward projected FX rate for maturity T at time 0 (valuation date)
\item $\sigma$: the volatility of the FX forward rate
\item $\omega$: 1 for a call option (ie receiving spot FX and paying strike), -1 for a put option
\item $P(T)$: the discount factor for maturity time $T$
\end{itemize}
