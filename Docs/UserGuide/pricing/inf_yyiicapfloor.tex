\subsubsection{Year-on-Year Cap/Floor}
\label{pricing:inf_yyiicapfloor}

The Year-on-Year Inflation Indexed Swap exchanges a series of ``Swaplet'' payoffs 
$$
\Pi_{YYIIS}(T) = y(T) = \frac{I(T)}{I(S)} - 1
$$
for fixed payments, each paid at respective period end $T$. \\

A related Caplet/Floorlet payoff, fixed at period end $T$, is:
$$
\Pi_{YYIICF}(T) = \left(\omega(y(T) - K)\right)^+ 
$$

\medskip
The time $t$ price of the Caplet/Floorlet (in the T-Forward measure) is then
$$
\NPV_{YYIICF}(t) = P(t,T)\,\E^T_t\left[ \left(\omega(y(T) -K)\right)^+\right] 
$$

Consider the {\em Forward Year-on-Year Rate} as seen at time $t$
$$
Y(t) = \frac{\Pi_{YYIIS}(t)}{P(t,T)} = \E^T_t\left[y(T)\right], \qquad Y(T)= y(T),
$$
a ratio of tradable assets and a Martingale in the T-Forward measure. 

\medskip
Assuming e.g. $dY(t) = \sigma\,dW(t)$ then leads to a Bachelier formula for the 
year-on-year caplet/floorlet price as of today
$$
\NPV(0) %= P(t,T)\:\E^T_t\left[ \left(\omega(y(T) - K)\right)^+\right] 
= P(t,T)\: \mbox{Bachelier}(K, Y(t),\sigma\sqrt{T}, \omega)
$$

\medskip
Caps/Floors are composed of a series of YYII Caplets/Floorlets.
YYII Caps/Floors are quoted in terms of prices by maturity and strike in a range 
from negative to positive, e.g. -1\% to 6\%. We convert them to equivalent 
normal volatilities $\sigma_{r,T}$.
