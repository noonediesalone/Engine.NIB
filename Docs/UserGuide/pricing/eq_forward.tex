\subsubsection{Equity Forward}
\label{pricing::eq_forward}

The equity forwarding curve is used for respective underlying equity. The net 
present value of an equity forward can be priced discounting the cashflows at 
maturity as:
$$
\NPV = \mbox{Quantity}\cdot\omega (S(0,T)-K)\cdot P(T)
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantity : number of shares of the underlying equity
\item $K$: Strike price
\item $S(0,T)$: the forward equity price for maturity T at valuation time 0 (calibrated to incorporate dividends, (Lichters, Stamm, \& Gallagher, 2015) Ch 14.1
\item $P(t)$: the discount factor for maturity time $T$
\item $\omega$: 1 for a forward to buy equity, -1 for a forward to sell equity 
\end{itemize}
