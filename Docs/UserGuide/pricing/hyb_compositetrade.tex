\subsubsection{Composite Trade}
\label{pricing:composite_trade}

Composite Trades are priced as the sum of their component trades. As such, the pricing model of the composite trade is a combination of the pricing models of each trade:

$$
\NPV=\sum_i \NPV_i
$$

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\NPV_i$: is the NPV of each component trade, $i$.
\end{itemize}
