\subsubsection{Flexi Swap}
\label{pricing:ir_flexiswap}

Flexi Swaps are priced following the Replication Approach described in (F. Jamshidian, 2005). The replicating basket of
Bermudan Swaptions is priced using the method as described under Product Type ``Bermudan Swaption'', but using one
global calibration for all swaptions derived from the flexi swap structure.

Prepayment option types ``ReductionByAbsoluteAmount'' and ``ReductionUpToAbsoluteAmount'' are both treated approximately
by generating a schedule of deterministic, lower notional bounds from them assuming that all earlier prepayment options
were executed.
