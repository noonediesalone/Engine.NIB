\subsubsection{FX KIKO Barrier Option}
\label{pricing:fx_kikobarrieroption}

FX KIKO Barrier Options are priced by replication, this replication strategy is briefly described in \cite{Clark_2011} and \cite{Wystup_2006}
The strategy makes use of FX Barrier Options and FX Double Barrier Options.
There are three replications cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The Knock-In barrier has been triggered before the evaluation date}: A knock-Out option with the knock-out barrier level is priced.
\item \textbf{The knock-In barrier is untriggered, the FX spot is between the two barriers}: This is replicated as follow
$$
\NPV(barrier_{knockOut}, barrier_{knockIn}) = NPV_{KO}(barrier_{knockOut}) - NPV_{DKO}(barrier_{knockOut}, barrier_{knockIn})
$$

where $NPV_{KO}$ is the NPV for a knock-out single barrier option, and $NPV_{DKO}$ is the NPV for a double barrier knock-out option.

\item \textbf{The knock-In barrier is untriggered, the FX spot is above or below the two barriers}: This is replicated as follows:
$$
\NPV(barrier_{knockOut}, barrier_{knockIn}) = NPV_{KO}(barrier_{knockOut}) - NPV_{KO}(barrier_{knockIn})
$$



\end{enumerate}
