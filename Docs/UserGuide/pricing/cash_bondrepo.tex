\subsubsection{Bond Repo}

The cash leg of a bond repo is priced using either a mark to market or accrual approach. In the mark to market approach the
outstanding future interest and notional payments are discounted on a rate curve build from quoted repo instruments
(assuming these are available). In the accrual approach the price of the cash leg is defined as the outstanding notional
plus accrued interests.

The security leg of a bond repo is priced as a cash bond, i.e. the present value of this leg is the dirty price of the
bond provided as collateral.

The total price of the bond repo can either be defined as the difference of the security leg and the cash leg (repo) or
vice versa (reverse repo) or also as the price of the cash leg alone. In the former case the price reflects the value of
the un- or over-collateralized part of the transaction, in the latter case the price reflects the value of the future
cash leg payments alone.
