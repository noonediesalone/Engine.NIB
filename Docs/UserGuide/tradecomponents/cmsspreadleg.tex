\subsubsection{CMS Spread Leg Data}
\label{ss:cmsspreadlegdata}

A CMS Spread leg consists of coupons that are linked to differences (spreads)
of CMS index fixings with different maturities. When these are capped and/or floored,
then the leg (assuming NakedOption \emph{true}) contains a sequence of CMS Spread Options with payoff
$$
N\cdot\left[(\CMS_m -\CMS_n - K)\right]^+ = N\cdot \max(0,\CMS_m-\CMS_n - K)
$$
where $N$ is the notional amount, $\CMS_{n/m}$ is the $n/m$ year CMS rate,
and $K$ is the strike.

Listing \ref{lst:cmsspreadlegdata} shows an example for a leg of type CMSSpread.

The elements of the CMSSpreadLegData block are identical to those of the CMSLegData (see \ref{ss:cmslegdata}), except
for the index which is defined by two CMS indices as the difference between \verb+Index1+ and \verb+Index2+.

The payout for each coupon is thus:

$
N \cdot (gearing \cdot (Index1 - Index2) + Spread)  \cdot daycountfraction
$

Adding a cap, and assuming no spread,  a gearing of 1, a daycount fraction of 1, and a notional of 1, the payout becomes:

$
min (Cap; Index1 - Index2) 
$

If there is a floor instead of a cap, the payout is:

$
max (Floor; Index1 - Index2) 
$

Note that a CMS Spread Option can be created by setting NakedOption to \emph{true}. With this setting, the payout for the CMS Spread leg with a cap becomes an option with the cap rate as strike:

$
max (0; (Index1 - Index2) - Cap) 
$

And the payout for a CMS Spread leg with a floor, and with NakedOption set to \emph{true} is :

$
max (0; Floor - (Index1 - Index2))
$
