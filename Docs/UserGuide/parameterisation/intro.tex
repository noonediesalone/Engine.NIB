A run of ORE is kicked off with a single command line parameter: 

\medskip
\centerline{\tt ore[.exe] ore.xml}
\medskip

which points to the 'master input file' referred to  as {\tt ore.xml} subsequently. 

This file is the starting point of the engine's configuration explained in the following sub section.
An overview of all input configuration files respectively all output files is shown in Table \ref{tab_1} respectively Table \ref{tab_2}.
To set up your own ORE configuration, it might be not be necessary to start from scratch, but instead use any of the examples discussed
in section \ref{sec:examples} as a boilerplate and just change the folders, see section \ref{sec:master_input}, and the trade data,
see \cite{products}, together with the netting definitions, see section \ref{sec:nettingsetinput}.
